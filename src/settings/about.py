This Application is used to calculate the light distribution of various headlight systems
and comparing them to other headlight systems available in the database. \n
Please take the following steps to avoid any Errors: \n
1) Upload the .ies files either in a single .zip folder containing the subfolders ADB, HB, and LB or separately with the corresponding buttons. The second methode does not require specific file names.\n
2) Check the ADB box if the data contains ADB light distributions.\n
3) Adjust installation height and headlamp width, otherwise  
   default values (height=0.75, width=1.5) will be used. \n
4) Click on Compute to start the computation. After a brief amount of time 
   the results should appear on the upper windows in table form and 
   plots should appear in thier corresponding tabs.\n
5) The results can be exported either in .xlsx or .csv format.'''
